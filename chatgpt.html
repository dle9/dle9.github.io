        Hey, this page was created using ChatGPT. 
        Here is its response to "aggregate all of the prompts in this session into a single prompt:" 
        Certainly, here's an aggregated prompt that includes all the prompts and instructions from this session:

        "Create a web page containing information about how artificial intelligence can be used for cybersecurity. Remove the <nav> section since I already have my own nav section. Also, embed a couple of links throughout the page that take the user to websites with more information relating to what you are talking about.
        
        Nice, now add classes to the HTML file and create a CSS style sheet for a dark and professional look. Use a retro theme and make the font like arcade text.
        
        Here is my header. Include CSS styles for the global-header class and its h1 and ul elements to make it horizontal across the top of the page.
        
        The items inside nav are still flowing top to bottom. I want them left to right at the top of the screen.
        
        Here is my current HTML file. Nav links are still not horizontal.
        
        Maybe you are misunderstanding. I want the nav links to go from left to right.
        
        Here is my CSS file. Why is it not working?
        
        I want to add a message underneath the title explaining that the webpage was created by ChatGPT.
        
        Include the prompts I used in the explanation.
        
        The final prompt should be underneath the title. Right now it is to the left of the title.
        
        Create a textbox underneath the title that shows the final prompt for this website.
        
        Aggregate all of the prompts in this session into a single prompt."
