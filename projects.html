                    The first project I'll be talking about is one I did the summer of 2023.
                    My goal was to get experience in cybersecurity attacks 
                    and ways to defend against those attacks. Using VirtualBox, I created a virtual
                    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://linuxhandbook.com/homelab/">
                    homelab</a> with a web server, firewall, and basic Ubuntu machines. I learned how to create 
                    my own web server with Apache and MySQL, configure firewalls, create Suricata rules to
                    detect malicious activity, exploit/defend against web application vulnerabilities, and more.

            <div id="projects-text-2" class="projects-content">
                <h1>
                    Another one of my (group) projects was for a 
                    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam">
                    Game jam</a> here at A&M. We used Ursina, a game engine library in Python, to create
                    a 3D first-person shooter where the user is placed in a 
                    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/alludent/acc-challenge2023">
                    post-apocalyptic world filled with hostile robots</a>. 
                    Creating a 3D shooter game within 1-2 weeks was a bit overconfident
                    since most of us hadn't ever made a game before. Nevertheless, we did the best we could; my contributions being:
                    the grappling hook logic, enemy spawning, and code organization.

                    The final project I'll be talking about was also done the summer of 2023. Using Rust, 
                    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/alludent/rustyrpg">
                    I created a simple RPG</a> 
                    played on the command line. The user starts with 
                    a handful of currency, and can play a variety of mini-games to increase their
                    net worth. As an alternative to generating money, they can buy and sell items 
                    from the Market or explore the dungeon. This project was a great way to learn 
                    about the Rust fundamentals, i.e., ownership, types, memory management, etc.
